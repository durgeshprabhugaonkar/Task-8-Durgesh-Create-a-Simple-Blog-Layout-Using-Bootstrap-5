# Simple & Responsive Blog (Bootstrap 5)

This project is a straightforward, responsive blog website created using **Bootstrap 5**. It showcases how to build a clean and functional front-end with essential features for a modern blog.

## What's Inside?

This project demonstrates:

-   **Responsive Layouts:** The blog looks great on any device, from phones to desktops, thanks to Bootstrap's powerful grid system.
-   **Multi-Page Navigation:** Each blog post has its own dedicated page, allowing for clear and organized content.
-   **Interactive Elements:**
    -   **Clickable Blog Cards:** Visually appealing cards that lead to individual blog posts.
    -   **Live Search:** A search bar on the homepage to quickly find posts by title or description.
-   **Professional Footer:** A tidy footer fixed at the bottom of the page, including social media links for easy connection.
-   **Clean Code:** The project's code is organized into separate HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (interactivity) files for easy understanding and maintenance.
